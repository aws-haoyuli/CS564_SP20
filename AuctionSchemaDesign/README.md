## ERModeling&SchemaDesign

## OVERVIEW

We provide you with a fairly large volume of data downloaded (over a decade ago!) from the eBay web
site and stored in JSON files. JSON is a model primarily used to store semi-structured data. It has become
increasing popular in recent years, and, for now, you can treat it as just another type of data that is very
straightforward to read.
In this project, you will examine the data and apply the principles of database design that we learned
in class in order to implement a good relational schema for it. You will then write a Python program to
transform the data from its JSON form into SQLite’s load file format, conforming to your relational schema.
You will create your schema in a SQLite database, load your transformed data, and test it by running some
SQL queries over it.
